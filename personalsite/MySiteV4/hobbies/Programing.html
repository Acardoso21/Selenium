      <h1>Programing History</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32">How I learned to program</h5>

      <p class="text-grey">I started to learn how to program in 2017 when I took a course offered by ID Tech. In this course I learned the basics of binary, hexadecimal, c++, and python.
        My final project was a game of open hand black jack with up to 4 players. After this I did some programing but didn't work on anything substantial for a few years.
         In 2019 I started taking a computer science class as part of my highschool education, the class was IB higher level Computer Science.
         This class also went over the basics of binary and hexadecimal, but focused almost completely on Java programing. As well as covering some computer engineering and networks subjects.
         My final project for this class was a Google Chrome extension, this was done mostly in JavaScript, with some html and Json needed too. During this time I also started working on more personal projects such as a game of tic tac toe where the user plays against my code.
         In my first year of college I relearned and refined my knowledge of C++ in a class called Cornerstone of Engineering. I also learned some Matlab in this class.
         In the second semester of my first year I took a class called Fundaments of Computing which was focused on Python, this class helped me refine my understanding of python and learn how to make my code more efficient and effective.
         My final project for this class was a twitter bot which would collect ten thousand tweets related to the popular game wordle and use those tweets to calculate the difficulty of that day's word.
         And at the time of writing this I am working on my personal site, which is using html and css.
