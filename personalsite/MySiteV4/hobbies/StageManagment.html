      <h1>Stage Managment Experience</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32"> I started learning how to be a stagemanager at 12 years old, I was invited to be assistant stage manager for a highschool performance of rent. Here I learned what it meant to be a stagemanager and what I would have to do. Bellow is a list of some of the more notable shows I worked on, and my roles in each.</h5>

      <p>Willy Wonka: I was stage manager, and I “called the show”. I was involved in all the production meetings from mid september 2018, auditions and casting of actors, i attended 2X a week rehearsals, checking and reporting attendance of all actors, reporting progress. I also selected the backstage crew.  I attended production meetings with the producer, director, costume designer, etc . I was the only student in these meetings. Every night after each show I made sure everything was properly stored to be ready for the following show. Many of these meetings were done over skype as our set designer was in Europe and would only arrive in NY 8 days before the show 
        In this role i learned leadership, managing and motivating other people, improvising and troubleshooting (during one of the shows  some student actors got locked in the dressing room, the door handle broke, i heard about it over the earphones and suggested they called maintenance to break in, and then we duck tape the bolt so this wouldn’t happen again).

    <p> Twelfth Night: I was stage manager, for a cast of about 25, and a crew of 5. Sadly, due to covid, we were forced to make our show digital, having each member of the cast film their own videos and the director edited them together.</p>
    <p> Grease The musical: I was prop master for Grease, our set designer lives abroad and came over for only one week to build the set including a full-size car that was rolled on to the stage</p>
    <p> Xanadu: I was a member of the backstage crew, there were 7 other people in the crew. I and one other member of the crew were in charge of everything on stage left.</p>
    <p> Romeo & Juliet: I was prop master, this involved going through all the props in the school drama department storage and helping select, identify and place orders to purchase what was missing.  Organize all the props to ensure they are ready to go on stage. At the end of each show the props needed to be checked and sorted again to be ready for the next show.</p>

      <h1>The Cult that Made Spoons</h1>
      <h5 class="padding-32">Edinburgh Fringe Festival - part of a UNIS theater group, we wrote and produced an original play :”the cult that made spoons: a fork in the road”.  We performed 1 show in NY and 4 shows for the public in Edinburgh.  To help fund the cost of this trip I sold popcorn during PTC and afterschool, I raised about 20% of the cost of my trip. </h5>
